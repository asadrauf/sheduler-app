### Quizz App
In this app, i am going to use fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and local storage API skills to build a scheduler app. This application will be able to store Hourly base tasks into local storage and will keep it persistent even if we refresh the page. I am using a clear button that will clear the local storage and will reload the the page auto once user click on it

* * Completed Tasks 
    * [x] Used Local Storage 
    * [x] JSON parse and strigify
    * [x] Resposive for 768px Device
    * [x] Resposive for 980px Device
    * [x] Using addEventListner strategy
    * [x] Good naming convention practice
    * [x] Spacing and indentation practice



    * Media Queries Example

    ```css
      @media (min-width: 576px) { ... }
    ```

    ```css
      @media (min-width: 992px) { ... }
    ```
